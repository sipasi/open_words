# Open Words

**Open Words** is a simple yet powerful app for creating personal dictionaries, reviewing vocabulary through games, and learning foreign languages.

This app is the **next generation** of my earlier [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/sipasi/OpenDictionary), now fully rewritten in **Flutter** with expanded **functionality** and a **modern UI**..

> For the best results, use **English** as the base language along with the language you're learning.

## Data Format (Import/Export JSON)

The app uses a clean and simple **JSON** format for **importing** and **exporting** dictionaries.
Internally, Open Words stores data in a **local SQL database** for performance and scalability.

### Example JSON

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Nature",
    "origin": "en",
    "translation": "uk",
    "words": [
      { "origin": "tree", "translation": "–¥–µ—Ä–µ–≤–æ" },
      { "origin": "garden", "translation": "—Å–∞–¥" },
      { "origin": "mountain", "translation": "–≥–æ—Ä–∞" }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Structure

Each dictionary (or word group) is represented as an object inside a JSON array:

- **`name`**: The title of the word group (e.g., `"Nature"`).
- **`origin`**: Either an ISO language code (e.g., `"en", "uk"`)
- **`translation`**: Same as `origin`, but for the target language.
- **`words`**: An array of word pairs:
  - `origin`: Word in the source language
  - `translation`: Corresponding word in the target language

This flexible and minimal structure makes it easy to back up, share, and transfer your vocabulary across devices.
 
## Data Sources

Open Words fetches English word metadata ‚Äî including definitions, phonetics, synonyms, and antonyms ‚Äî from the [Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/), a free and open-source dictionary API.

Example API request for the word "advice":
